# Introduction to Logicistic Regression using R.
## Overview
Dr. Dickson explains how to use linear classification in R to detect when a nuclear isotope detection system may be inaccurate.

## Background
In one of Ryan's doctoral programs scientist tried to answer the question as to whether it was possible to detect the condictions under which an nuclear isotoope detection system would give a false positive. This would help in triaging cases in the event of a nuclear disaster. Thse devices were to be placed in ambulances to allow first responders to avert speading contaminants to a wider clinical population.

## Presentation
Through a series of slides and demo using a subset of data, Ryan showed the group how to arrive at statistical conclusions and some confidence of predictions using the R statiscal package.
